# Description
It would be great for a developer/QA/PO/support/â€¦ to be able to create a package for any specified branch from the GitHub UI, like in some of our projects. 
Also it would be convenient if there is a way to enter the version string, which will be displayed in WP and included in the .zip name.

# Scenario: Creating a Package for a Specific Branch
GIVEN I am a developer
AND have sufficient access rights for the plugin repo
WHEN I triggered the package creation for the branch X with entered version 
THEN I can download the package
AND as an admin I can install it on a WP website
AND I can see that the package does not contain files needed only for development, temporary build files
AND I can see 
AND I can see 
AND I can see that the code inside is based on the branch X
