# Description

As a WordPress administrator,
I want the plugin to be compatible with the default WordPress theme and Storefront,
So that the plugin functions correctly and maintains a consistent user experience.

#### Scenario: Ensuring Compatibility with Default Themes

GIVEN @[WooCommerce store is configured, default theme]
AND I @[perform a transaction, with any product, with Worldline as the payment method, status authorized]
WHEN I @[visit, the plugin log page]
THEN I @[should see, in the WooCommerce order details, the transaction processed successfully without disrupting the siteâ€™s layout or user experience]
